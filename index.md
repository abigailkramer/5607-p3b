## Project Overview

This part of the project went pretty well, since I was able to achieve a decent bit of it for project 3a. Refraction gave me a little bit of trouble, in terms of getting the right ray. I was initially failing to take into account whether or not the ray was leaving or entering an object in the image. Once that was sorted out, I just needed to clean up my formula (a square root was forgotten), and I was all set. Parallelizing the raytracer took a little bit of work, mainly just a bit of research to figure out how OpenMP was actually used. It seems to work quite well. Rendering the images on my computer is *very* slow in general (especially for the new example text files), so the difference to me was drastic.
